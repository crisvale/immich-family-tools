# Changelog

All notable changes to Immich Family Tools are documented here.

## [1.7.0] – 2026-09-21

**Risk: backup**

This release migrates `accounts.json`. Read the upgrade notes before you rebuild.

### Album groups no longer hang on the album name

The app groups managed albums so that several real Immich albums — one per account — count as _one_ family album. Until now that grouping was done **by name**: two albums were the same group if they happened to be called the same thing.

That had two consequences you could actually hit:

- **Two unrelated albums that share a name were treated as one group.** A face pair could then be counted as "already has an album" when in fact no album contained both — and the suggestion was **silently dropped**. A missing suggestion is harder to notice than a duplicate one.
- **A name you typed slightly differently made a second group.** "Familie 2024" and "Familie" never found each other.

Each group now carries an identifier of its own. The name is only a label. Renaming an album — in the app or directly in Immich — cannot split a group any more.

### Error messages from the server are translated (#74)

Every message the server sends now carries a key, and the app renders it in your language. Previously these were German no matter which language you had picked. If the app meets a message it does not know, it still shows the German sentence rather than an empty box.

### A smaller fix you may notice

When you link an **existing** Immich album and leave the name field empty, the app now fetches the album's real name instead of storing its internal id. Album lists used to show a long string of letters and digits in that case.

### Upgrade notes

- **This release migrates `accounts.json`.** On first start, every managed album is given a group identifier, derived once from the names you have today — so your existing groups stay exactly as they are.
- **The migration is reversible.** Measured: an older container reads a migrated file without complaint, and going back and forth leaves the groups and the data untouched. A `.bak` is written next to the file as usual; a ZFS snapshot beforehand is still the better safety net.
- **One deliberate change at migration time:** albums whose name is **empty or only spaces** each get their own group instead of sharing one. An empty name says nothing about belonging, and unlike before, the grouping is now permanent. If you have no such albums, nothing changes for you. To check beforehand:
  ```
  python -c "import json;d=json.load(open('accounts.json'));print([a['album_name'] for a in d.get('managed_albums',[]) if not str(a.get('album_name','')).strip()])"
  ```
  An empty list means this does not affect you.
- Rebuild the container so backend and frontend both report `1.7.0`.

### Still open

Creating an album still joins a group **by name**, so two albums you name the same still end up together whether you meant it or not. Choosing the group explicitly is tracked as #81.

## [1.6.0] – 2026-09-06

**Risk: safe**

### Spanish (#73)

- The app is now available in **Spanish**, contributed by [@crisvale](https://github.com/crisvale) — terminology kept consistent with Immich's own Spanish localisation. Pick it in the language switcher next to 🇩🇪 DE, 🇬🇧 EN and 🇧🇷 PT-BR.
- All 183 strings are translated, including the login screen and the sync log. Nothing falls back to German.
- A browser set to any Spanish variant — `es`, `es-MX`, `es-AR` — starts the app in Spanish on the first visit.
- Dates read `4 mar 2026, 14:30`.

### The language switcher holds more than four languages now

- The switcher used to be a single row that split the available width between the buttons. It fitted four, and it fitted them exactly: measured in the real sidebar, the longest label had about **three pixels** to spare.
- It is now a two-column grid. Every button keeps the same width no matter how many languages ship, and new ones wrap onto a new row instead of squeezing the existing ones.
- The active language now also carries `aria-current`, so screen readers announce which one is selected — before, it was only marked by colour.

### Under the hood, for anyone translating

Two guards were added after a review found that a translation could be _structurally_ wrong without anything noticing:

- A translation entry that is a string in three languages and a function in the fourth used to compile and pass every test — and render the word `undefined` on screen. That now fails to build.
- A language that takes fewer arguments than its siblings, or an empty string, now turns the test suite red.
- The list of shipped languages in the README is checked against the switcher itself, so it can no longer quietly go stale.

None of this changes what you see. It changes what can reach you.

### One German typo

- The rename hint read `Person auf „Name" umbenennen` — an opening German quote closed with a straight one. It now closes properly: `Person auf „Name“ umbenennen`. Spotted by a reviewer in passing; it had been there since the string was written.

### Upgrade notes

- **No data migration.** Rebuild the container so backend and frontend both report `1.6.0`.
- Your chosen language is remembered per browser, unchanged. If you have never chosen one, the browser's language decides.

### Please test

- Switch to Spanish and walk through accounts, people, matches and the sync log — this is the first release with a language none of the maintainers speaks.
- Look at the language switcher itself: four buttons in two rows, all the same size, nothing clipped.
- If anything reads oddly in Spanish, a comment on #73 is very welcome.

### Still German, and known

Error messages coming from the server are still German in every language — you may see `Error: Account nicht gefunden`. That is tracked in #76 and is the largest remaining gap in the translation.

## [1.5.0] – 2026-09-06

**Risk: safe**

### Portuguese (Brazil), and a login screen that speaks your language (#65, #71)

- The app is now available in **Portuguese (Brazil)**, contributed by [@fitocazo](https://github.com/fitocazo) — their first open-source contribution. Pick it in the language switcher next to 🇩🇪 DE and 🇬🇧 EN.
- The **login screen is translated**. Until now it was German for everyone, in every language — the first screen anyone sees was the one screen the language switch never reached.
- **Login errors say what actually happened**, in your language: a rejected token, too many attempts, or a general failure. Before, a failed login showed whatever the server had said — raw, untranslated, sometimes just `HTTP 429`. The technical detail now goes to the browser console instead of at you.
- On a **first visit** the app follows your browser's language instead of always starting in German.
- `<html lang>` now matches the chosen language, so screen readers and browser translation get it right.

### Dates read as dates (#71)

- Timestamps now spell the month instead of numbering it, in each language:

  |           | before              | now                        |
  | --------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
  | Deutsch   | `04.03.2026, 15:30` | `4. März 2026, 15:30`      |
  | English   | `04/03/2026, 15:30` | `4 Mar 2026, 15:30`        |
  | Português | `04/03/2026, 15:30` | `4 de mar. de 2026, 15:30` |

- Why it was worth changing: `04/03/2026` is 4 March to a Brazilian reader and 3 April to an American one, and nothing on screen says which. A spelled-out month cannot be read the wrong way round.
- **A broken timestamp no longer shows as `Invalid Date`.** Album lists, match extension and the sync log now show `–` for a date the server could not deliver — and they all use the same formatting routine, so no corner of the app renders dates its own way any more.

### Also in this release, if you are coming from 1.4.3

Version 1.4.4 was tagged but never rolled out here, so its changes arrive with this one:

- **Sync log retention** (90 days, at most 500 entries) now applies when the log is **read**, not only as a side effect of writing. With auto-sync off, nothing ever expired before.
- Entries with an unreadable timestamp are **kept** rather than silently dropped: a broken clock is not evidence that an entry is old.
- Entries that cannot be turned into a log record at all are skipped on read with a warning and removed on the next write.

### Upgrade notes

- **No data migration.** Rebuild the container so backend and frontend both report `1.5.0`.
- Coming from 1.4.3: sync-log entries older than 90 days disappear from the view after the update, and are removed from disk on the next write. That is the 1.4.4 change above, not a new one.
- Your chosen language is remembered in the browser, per device. Nothing to do.

### Please test

- Switch the language while logged in, and after a fresh reload — the choice should survive both.
- Open the app in a private window with a Portuguese or English browser: the login screen should already be in that language.
- Look at any timestamp in the sync log and the album list — same format, month spelled out.

## [1.4.4] – 2026-08-19

### Sync log retention (#56)

- The retention rule (90 days, at most 500 entries) now applies on **read** as well, not only as a side effect of writing. Previously entries only aged out when a sync action happened to write — with auto-sync off, nothing ever expired.
- Entries whose timestamp cannot be parsed are **kept** instead of silently discarded: a broken clock is not evidence that an entry is old.
- Naive (timezone-less) timestamps are interpreted as UTC instead of raising.
- Entries that cannot be turned into a log record at all (e.g. after a hand-restored `accounts.json`) are skipped on read **with a warning**, and removed on the next write — the store heals itself again.

### Upgrade notes

- No data migration. Sync-log entries older than 90 days disappear from the UI after the update; they are removed from disk on the next write.
- Rebuild the container so backend and frontend both report version `1.4.4`.

## [1.4.3] – 2026-08-07

- TypeScript migrated staged 5.9.3 → 6.0.3 → 7.0.2 (nativer Compiler), tracked in #50; the PR #44 build failure was `noUncheckedSideEffectImports` (new default `true` since 6.0) catching a missing `vite/client` type reference, not a tsconfig incompatibility with 7.0
- `frontend/tsconfig.json` modernized for the new TS 6.0/7.0 defaults: added `frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts`, plus explicit `esModuleInterop`, `noUncheckedSideEffectImports`, `types: []`

### Upgrade notes

- No data migration; rebuild the container

## [1.4.2] – 2026-08-07

- Per-item results of album asset additions are now evaluated — totals count real successes, real failures are logged, duplicates are ignored silently (#46)
- Unified pagination contract for search/metadata with progress guard against endless loops (#47)

### Upgrade notes

- No data migration; rebuild the container

## [1.4.1] – 2026-08-07

- Version guard for Immich <3 on account add/update (#45)
- CI now builds the frontend with Node 22, matching the shipped image (#48)
- README confidence documentation reflects embedding unavailability on Immich v3.1 (#49)

### Upgrade notes

- No data migration; rebuild the container

## [1.4.0] – 2026-08-07

### Localization (#39)

- Sync Log messages and album sync results are now fully localized (DE/EN): log entries carry a structured `message_key` + `message_params`, rendered through the frontend translation layer in all four consumers (Sync Log, Albums overview, Manual Matching, Extend Match)
- Entries persisted before this release keep their original German text as fallback

### API robustness

- Name Sync uses the documented `PUT /api/people/:id` endpoint again instead of the undocumented `PATCH` variant (result of a three-voice external code review; PUT is the stable primary endpoint in Immich v3.1 and also works on v2)
- README now states Immich v3.x as the required minimum version

### Maintenance

- Dependency updates: fastapi 0.141.1, uvicorn 0.52.1, @types/react 19.2.18, @types/react-dom 19.2.4, actions/setup-python v7
- TypeScript 7 major update deliberately deferred (tracked in PR #44)
- Review follow-ups filed as issues #45–#49

### Upgrade notes

- No persisted-data migration required; existing accounts, managed albums and sync history remain compatible
- Rebuild the container so backend and frontend both report version `1.4.0`

## [1.3.0] – 2026-08-02

### Immich v3 compatibility

- Added tested compatibility with Immich v3.1
- Migrated person asset discovery to the paginated `POST /api/search/metadata` API
- Updated people pagination to use Immich v3's `size` parameter
- Updated Name Sync to modify people through `PATCH`
- Deduplicated paginated asset IDs and prevented assets already present in an album from being added again

### Auto-Sync reliability

- Auto-Sync now records the executed date and configured time as one slot
- Changing the configured time allows one intentional additional run on the same day
- An unchanged time slot remains protected against duplicate runs during the polling window

### Maintenance and verification

- Updated tested backend, frontend and GitHub Actions dependencies
- Added regression coverage for Immich v3 album search, people pagination, Name Sync and scheduled synchronization
- Verified manual and automatic album synchronization against Immich v3.1 in production
- Backend tests, frontend tests, typecheck, production build, audits, secret scan and container build pass

### Upgrade notes

- No persisted-data migration is required
- Existing `.env`, accounts, managed albums and sync history remain compatible
- Rebuild the container from this release so the backend and frontend both report version `1.3.0`

## [1.2.1] – 2026-06-21

### Maintenance

- Updated backend runtime dependencies to their tested current minor/patch releases
- Updated React and React DOM together to 19.2.7 with matching type packages
- Updated Lucide, pytest and pytest-asyncio after compatibility testing
- Updated GitHub checkout and Node setup actions
- Fixed Gitleaks authentication for Dependabot pull requests
- Grouped and limited Dependabot updates to reduce pull-request noise

### Verification

- Backend tests, frontend tests, production build and container build pass
- npm audit, pip-audit and Gitleaks report no known findings
- No application features, persisted data or Immich API behavior changed

## [1.2.0] – 2026-06-20

### Security

- Added shared-token login with signed HttpOnly sessions, logout and login rate limiting
- Immich API keys never leave the backend; account responses expose only configuration status
- Restricted album sharing to accounts participating in the selected match
- Disabled HTTP redirects for Immich API requests and validated configured URLs
- Added Same-Origin browser policy, security headers and no-store caching for sensitive API data
- Hardened `accounts.json` with schema validation, atomic writes, backups and restrictive permissions

### Reliability

- Fixed name-sync undo by reading and storing the previous name before mutation
- Added preflight validation, duplicate protection, partial state and per-album synchronization locks
- Account removal now clears local references and caches without modifying Immich
- Automatic matching now covers all named people with bounded embedding concurrency; unnamed people remain manual
- Sync logs are retained for 90 days / 500 entries and can be cleared
- Added consistent application versioning and a minimal Docker health check

### Engineering

- Added backend and frontend tests, GitHub Actions CI, Dependabot and security scans
- Added reproducible frontend installs through a committed lockfile
- Added security, privacy, threat-model and backup/restore documentation

## [1.1.3] – 2026-06-01

### New Features

**Nightly Auto-Sync**

- Background task checks every 30 seconds if the configured time has been reached (server local time); fires exactly once per day
- Refreshes all managed albums automatically — no manual interaction needed
- `GET/PUT /api/sync/autosync-config` endpoint persists `{enabled, time}` in `accounts.json`; survives container restarts
- Toggle switch + time picker (`<input type="time">`) in the Albums view, next to "Sync all"
- Shows "Next sync: today/tomorrow at HH:MM"
- **Timezone:** container must have `TZ` set to your local timezone (default `Europe/Vienna`). Set `TZ=Europe/Berlin` etc. in `.env` for other timezones. Without this, the container runs in UTC and the sync fires at the wrong local time.

**Bulk Sync Results — Visual Feedback**

- "Sync all" now shows results per album card incrementally as each album finishes
- Each card shows a spinner while its albums are being processed, then immediately displays log entries (new assets / no new assets / errors)
- Consistent display with the individual "Sync now" button on each card

### Bug Fixes

- Auto-sync toggle now updates immediately without page refresh (missing `queryClient.invalidateQueries` on mutation success)

---

## [1.1.2] – 2026-05-31

### Bug Fixes

**Match Suggestions — Album & Multi-Account State Now Fully Consistent**

The match suggestion view was not correctly showing "Album linked" and the multi-account hint for all pairwise combinations of a connected person (e.g. Manuel across Manu, Majo and Jojo accounts).

Root cause: the logic relied on `linked_match_ids` stored per album, which were sometimes stale or incomplete after the album was extended.

Fix — transitive person-ref grouping (same logic in backend and frontend):

- Albums are grouped by normalised name; all `person_ids` across the group are collected; all pairwise combinations are derived from that set
- No reliance on stored `linked_match_ids` — derived fresh from `person_refs` on every request
- Works correctly regardless of how the connection was created (Match Suggestions, Manual Match, Extend Match)
- Covers transitive connections: Manu↔Majo + Majo↔Jojo in albums named "Manuel" → Manu↔Jojo is also correctly shown as connected

**ManualMatch — Removed "Create Shared Album" Checkbox**
Album creation is the core purpose of the page. The checkbox was removed; the album section is always visible.

**Version Display**
Sidebar now correctly shows v1.1.2 (was stuck at v1.1.0 in previous patch releases).

---

## [1.1.1] – 2026-05-31

### Bug Fixes

- **Photo count**: People grid lazy-loads count per person as fallback when Immich API returns `assetCount: 0` in list responses
- **ManualMatch alignment**: Page is now left-aligned (removed `mx-auto`)
- **ManualMatch album options**: Added owner account selector, mode toggle (new/existing album), existing album picker per owner

### New Backend

- `POST /api/sync/names-multi` now supports `existing_album_id` to link an existing album instead of creating a new one

---

## [1.1.0] – 2026-05-31

### New Features

#### Manuelles Matching / Manual Matching

- New page to manually match people across accounts when the automatic matcher misses them
- Per-account searchable person dropdowns (text filter, thumbnail preview, asset count)
- Assign a shared canonical name and optionally create a shared album in one step
- Accounts already selected in other rows are disabled to prevent duplicates
- Hint banner warns that this page is for new matches only → use _Match erweitern_ to extend existing ones

#### Match erweitern / Extend Match

- New page to add a new account/person to an existing shared album
- Shows all managed albums as selectable cards with full info: owner, linked persons (with coloured account badges), photo count, last sync date
- Only shows accounts not yet in the selected match
- Searchable person dropdown with thumbnail previews
- Checkbox "Namen synchronisieren" renames the new person to match the existing canonical name
- Backend shares the Immich album with the new account, adds the person's assets, and updates the stored `person_refs`

#### Account bearbeiten / Edit Accounts

- Accounts can now be edited in-place (name, Immich URL, API key, colour)
- Changes to URL or API key automatically re-validate the connection and refresh the Immich user ID
- Colour picker with 10 presets + full custom HTML colour input
- Edit form opens inline per account card; save is disabled until a change is made

#### Account-Farben / Account Colours

- Account colours are now shown consistently as coloured badges everywhere a person's account is referenced: People grid, Match suggestions, Albums overview, Extend Match, Manual Match
- `account_color` is now stored in all `person_refs` entries when albums are created or extended
- Frontend falls back to a live account lookup when older stored entries lack the colour field

#### DE / EN Sprachumschalter / Language Toggle

- Full German and English translation of all UI strings (~80 keys)
- Toggle button in the sidebar footer; preference is persisted in localStorage
- All dynamic strings (plurals, interpolated names) supported via typed translation function

### Improvements

#### People Grid — Paralleles Laden / Parallel Loading

- People are now fetched per account in parallel using `useQueries` instead of one aggregated call
- Results appear as each account responds — no more waiting for the slowest account
- Progress indicator shows `1/3 Accounts` with an animated progress bar while loading

#### Albums Overview — Gruppierung / Grouping

- Albums with the same name are merged into a single card
- Merged card shows all unique linked persons across all grouped entries
- Photo count uses the most-recently-synced entry (instead of incorrectly summing all entries)
- "Jetzt synchronisieren" and "Verknüpfung entfernen" operate on all entries in the group
- Owner name always resolved from live account data (no more UUID shown as owner)

#### Match Suggestions — Smarte Badges / Smart Badges

- `has_album` badge now correctly shows on all pairwise match cards that share a person appearing in any managed album — including albums created via _Match erweitern_
- `names_synced` badge now detected from live person names: if both persons already share the same non-empty name, the badge appears without requiring an explicit tool sync

### Bug Fixes

- `(0)` no longer appears next to person names in dropdowns when `asset_count` is zero
- "Unbekannt" / "?" in person_refs display now falls back to the album name for legacy entries that lack a stored `person_name`
- "Alle konfigurierten Accounts enthalten" warning no longer appears immediately after a successful extend (it is now hidden when a result is already shown)
- `"Albumen"` plural bug fixed → now correctly shows `"Alben"` / `"albums"`
- `"Namen erneut sync"` corrected to `"Namen erneut synchronisieren"`
- Account owner in Albums overview and Extend Match now always shows the account name, never the raw UUID

### API Changes (Backend)

| Method | Path                    | Description                                      |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `PUT`  | `/api/accounts/{id}`    | Edit account (name, URL, API key, colour)        |
| `POST` | `/api/sync/names-multi` | Sync name + create album for N persons at once   |
| `POST` | `/api/sync/extend`      | Add new account/person to existing managed album |
