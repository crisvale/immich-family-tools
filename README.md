Solving the missing cross-account face recognition problem via the Immich REST API, without touching your existing Immich installation.

## The Problem

Immich does not share face recognition across user accounts. If your family runs several separate Immich accounts on the same server, each account builds its own independent person database — even though 90% of the faces are the same people.

This tool bridges that gap.

## Features

### Core

- **People overview** — All recognized faces from every account plus consolidated linked identities with their source thumbnails, names, account badges, and combined photo count
- **Match suggestions** — Automatically detects the same person across accounts and lets you confirm the identity link directly from each suggestion
- **Name sync** — Set a canonical name across all matched persons with one click; bulk-sync for high-confidence matches
- **Linked people** — Record that face profiles from different accounts represent the same person without renaming either profile
- **Shared album** — Create a shared album containing all photos of a matched person, populated from each account's own API key
- **Conditional albums** — Select several people and include photos where at least a configurable number of them appear together (for example, at least 2 of 3 family members)
- **Sync log** — Full history of all actions with undo support for name syncs

### Manual Matching

- **Manuelles Matching** — Pick one person per account and either link them without changing Immich, or synchronize their names and optionally create/link an album
- **Match erweitern** — Add a new account/person to an existing shared album (e.g. when a new family member joins); shares the album, adds photos, and optionally renames the person

### Account Management

- **Account bearbeiten** — Edit name, Immich URL, API key and colour for any account; changes re-validate the connection automatically
- **Custom colours** — Each account has an assignable colour (10 presets + custom picker) shown consistently as badges everywhere in the UI

### UI & Internationalisation

- **Language toggle** — all languages from `LANG_LABELS`, currently **DE**, **EN**, **ES**, **PT-BR**, persisted in localStorage. The list is written with the switcher's own labels, and a test fails if a shipped language is missing here — this line went stale once already, in the release that added a fourth language.
- **Album grouping** — Albums with the same name are merged into one card in the overview, showing all linked persons across accounts
- **Smart badges** — "Names synced" and "Album linked" badges on match cards now correctly detect matches extended via _Match erweitern_

## How It Works

```
Immich Account A:  "Leonie" (own face DB)
Immich Account B:  "Leonie" (own face DB)
                        ↕
              Immich Family Tools detects:
              "Same person — 87% confidence"
                        ↕
         Actions: sync name · create shared album
         → Both face DBs remain untouched
```

### Conditional albums

First use **Manual Matching → Link people** to record identities that exist in several Immich accounts. Linking does not rename profiles or create an album; it only records that those profiles represent the same real person. Successful name synchronization also records the corresponding link automatically.

Then open **Albums** and choose **Create conditional album**. You can select linked identities, people local to the owner account, or both, set the minimum match count, and choose either a new album or an existing Immich album. For a family group of three where any two must be present, select all three identities and set the condition to **at least 2 of 3 people**. A linked identity always counts once even when it has profiles in several accounts.

The rule is evaluated from Immich's paginated person searches rather than from face data embedded in asset responses. It is therefore compatible with Immich 3.x, and the same rule is applied again by manual and scheduled album refreshes. Synchronization is additive: matching photos are added, while existing or manually added album contents are never removed.

**Automatic match suggestions are limited to named people.** Unnamed people
remain available in Manual Matching. Name similarity is the primary signal;
face embeddings — where the Immich instance still exposes them — add a
secondary boost on top:

| Signal                                                | Weight    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Name similarity (Levenshtein distance)                | up to 75% |
| Face embedding cosine similarity (legacy, if exposed) | up to 25% |

#### Signal details

**Name similarity** uses Levenshtein distance normalized to 0–1:

- `"Leonie"` vs `"Leonie"` → 100%
- `"Manuel"` vs `"Manu"` → 67%
- Any unnamed person → 0% (no signal)

**Face embeddings** are fetched via `GET /api/faces?id={assetId}`, on Immich versions that still expose embeddings through this endpoint. **Immich v3.1 no longer returns embeddings here**, so on current instances matching relies on name similarity alone; when embeddings are unavailable, matching falls back gracefully to names.

#### Why does "same name" only score ~75%?

Same name → **~75%** (correct match likely, unconfirmed) — this is the practical ceiling on Immich v3.1, since embeddings are no longer exposed there.  
Same name, embeddings also match (older Immich versions that still expose embeddings) → **~85–95%** (high confidence)  
Same name, different person → mark as _"Not the same person"_ to dismiss permanently

The minimum threshold to appear as a suggestion is **25%**.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- A running Immich instance, **version 3.x required** (tested against v3.1)
- API keys for each Immich account (User Settings → API Keys in Immich)

> **Immich v2 or older is not supported** since v1.3.0: album synchronization and people pagination rely on v3 API behavior (`size` pagination parameter, album inventory via `POST /api/search/metadata`). Because Immich does not backport fixes to older major versions, the latest stable Immich release is recommended.

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Trust1509/immich-family-tools.git
cd immich-family-tools
```

### 2. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set IMMICH_FAMILY_TOOLS_SECRET to a long random token.
```

### 3. Start

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open **http://localhost:3100** and add your Immich accounts.

## TrueNAS Scale Deployment

If you run Immich on TrueNAS Scale, ZFS volumes require POSIX ACLs. Run this **before** the first `docker compose up`:

```bash
# Create POSIX datasets (never mount Docker volumes directly on NFSv4 datasets)
zfs create -o acltype=posix -o xattr=sa HDDs/Applications/immich-family-tools
zfs create -o acltype=posix -o xattr=sa HDDs/Applications/immich-family-tools/data

# Set ownership for container user (UID/GID 3006)
chown -R 3006:3006 /mnt/HDDs/Applications/immich-family-tools/data
```

The `docker-compose.yml` is pre-configured for this layout.

## API Key Permissions

When creating API keys in Immich (**User Settings → API Keys → Create new key**), enable exactly these permissions:

| Permission          | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `user.read`         | Validate API key, fetch user ID for album sharing |
| `person.read`       | Load people list + thumbnails                     |
| `person.update`     | Rename person (name sync)                         |
| `person.statistics` | Load photo count per person                       |
| `asset.read`        | Load person's photos for album population         |
| `asset.view`        | Fetch thumbnail bytes                             |
| `face.read`         | Face embeddings for matching (experimental)       |
| `album.read`        | List existing albums, check current album members |
| `album.create`      | Create new shared album                           |
| `album.update`      | Update album metadata                             |
| `album.share`       | Share album with other users                      |
| `albumAsset.create` | Add photos to album                               |
| `albumUser.create`  | Add users as editors to album                     |
| `albumUser.update`  | Update user roles in album                        |

> **Note:** All accounts (owner and editors) need the same set of permissions since each account's API key is used to add its own assets to shared albums.

```

**No database required** — all data is loaded live from the Immich API. Only `accounts.json` (API keys + dismissed matches + managed albums + sync log) is persisted on the Docker volume.

> **Auto-Sync timezone note:** The nightly auto-sync compares the configured time against the container's local clock. Without a matching `TZ`, the container defaults to UTC — a sync scheduled for `01:00` would fire at `01:00 UTC`, which is `03:00` in `Europe/Vienna` (CEST). Set `TZ` in your `.env` file or directly in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored server-side in `accounts.json` and are never returned to the browser
- `accounts.json` is written atomically with mode `0600`; the data directory uses `0700`
- The shared-token login creates an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict session cookie
- This tool is designed for **internal network use only** and has no user management
- Do not expose it to the internet without HTTPS and an authenticated reverse proxy
- Shared albums are granted only to accounts participating in the selected match
- Sync logs are retained for 90 days and at most 500 entries
- All write operations (rename, create album, extend match) require explicit user confirmation in the UI

[Threat Model](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md), and [Backup & Restore](docs/BACKUP_RESTORE.md).
