## Backup

1. Snapshot the ZFS dataset containing `/app/data`.
2. Replicate snapshots to a protected second target.
3. Ensure `accounts.json`, `accounts.json.bak`, any
   `accounts.json.vor-schema-*.bak` **and `accounts.json.vor-kennungsvergabe.bak`**
   remain readable only by UID/GID 3006 (`0600`; directory `0700`). Both
   rollback kinds carry the same Immich API keys as `accounts.json` itself.
4. Treat every backup as a secret because it contains Immich API keys. This
   applies to the `vor-schema-*` files too — and to them for longer, because
   nothing overwrites or removes them (see _Schema migrations_ below).
5. The application checks this itself on every start
   (`backend/services/config_store.py`), where POSIX permission bits are
   reliable at all (skipped, with a reason logged, on Windows and similar
   filesystems), and only once the file has parsed successfully as a valid
   configuration — an invalid one is left untouched in every sense,
   including its permissions: for `accounts.json` itself, it does not merely
   warn — it **tightens the permission to `0600` right there** (the
   same it already enforces on every write) and logs one INFO line naming
   the previous mode, unless `accounts.json` is itself a symlink, in which
   case this is skipped and logged as a warning instead (the symlink's
   target is outside the app's own data, and an operator may have arranged
   it deliberately). For everything **else** it only warns, once, naming
   the offending path and mode, and does not touch it: a sibling whose name
   starts with `accounts.json.` (including a **hidden** one starting with
   `.accounts.json.` — an earlier version of this check missed those), or
   the data directory. This is a safety net, not a
   substitute for point 3 for anything other than `accounts.json` itself.

## Schema migrations

The app writes a rollback copy before anything it cannot undo. There are two,
and they behave differently on purpose:

- **`accounts.json.vor-schema-<N>.bak`** — written **once** before a schema
  migration and never overwritten while it is usable. `<N>` is the schema
  version it is migrating **to**; the file holds the state from _before_ that
  migration. **Exception (#120):** if a _usable_ copy already sits at the
  target, writing **this rollback copy** is skipped (and nothing is logged
  for it) — the schema migration itself still runs in full. **Known
  limitation (#130):** the existing copy holds the state from before the
  _first_ upgrade, not from before this one. You land in exactly this
  situation by following _Undoing a migration_ below and then upgrading
  again: anything you did in between is not in that copy. See _Undoing a
  migration_ for what to do instead.
- **`accounts.json.vor-kennungsvergabe.bak`** — written before the app
  assigns any album group identifiers that are still missing. That happens
  when an older version created an album without one — **independently of
  whether a schema migration also runs in the same start.** Measured: an
  old-format file (no `schema_version` key) with such an album writes
  **both** rollback files and logs **both** lines in a single run (#105);
  the two cases are not mutually exclusive, only worded and tested
  separately — this holds even when the Exception above skips the
  schema-migration copy: the identifier-assignment line (and file) still
  appears whenever an identifier is actually missing. **One generation
  only:** it is replaced on each such run, so it always holds the state
  from before the _most recent_ one. That is the state you would want
  back; a months-old copy would throw away everything since.

**This is the file you want after a migration, not `accounts.json.bak`.** The
ordinary `.bak` is rewritten on every save — including by the account backfill
that runs at startup, seconds after the migration. It stops being the
pre-migration state almost immediately.

**A third kind of start-time write gets no rollback copy of its OWN, and by
itself it is unrecoverable once it has run.** On every start, `_migrate`
also drops any managed-album reference to an account that no longer exists
(#117/#121/#103) — unlike the schema migration and the identifier assignment
above, this step does not write a `vor-*.bak` of its own. **An earlier
version of this paragraph said that held "regardless of whether it runs
together with either of them" — measured directly, that is wrong.** Both
rollback writes above happen at the _start_ of `_migrate`, copying whatever
is on disk _before_ anything in that same run changes it; the dead-reference
cleanup runs _after_ them, later in the same pass. So if a schema migration
or an identifier assignment **also** runs in that same start, the rollback
file it writes for its own reason incidentally still holds the dead
reference too — the person's name included — simply because it was taken
before the cleanup ran (measured: an old-format file with both a missing
schema version and a dead account reference writes `accounts.json.vor-
schema-<N>.bak` containing that dead reference's name). **Only when the
dead-reference cleanup runs _alone_ in a start — no schema jump, no missing
group identifier — is there truly no rollback copy of it beyond the
ordinary one:** the only place it survives at all is `accounts.json.bak`
— and only until the _next_ save overwrites that too (`PRIVACY.md`,
"the ordinary save leaves one more generation behind"). If you need to
recover a name or account association this way and neither rollback file
happens to carry it, ZFS snapshot restore is your only path.

Two things follow for you as the operator:

- **After you have confirmed an upgrade is good**, delete the rollback copies
  you no longer need. Nothing rotates the `vor-schema-*` files, and both kinds
  keep Immich API keys — including keys of accounts you have since deleted
  from the app, and log entries past the 90-day retention window. `PRIVACY.md`
  points here for that reason.
- If the file is missing after an upgrade, the migration still ran. Every
  line the `services.config_store` logger writes — the one that logs these
  rollback lines — is formatted `LEVEL  services.config_store  message`
  (`backend/main.py`'s log format); this is not a claim about every line the
  app logs overall, other loggers (e.g. the sync service) use their own
  name in that slot — except uvicorn's own lines (startup banner, access
  log): uvicorn formats those itself, and they do not follow this
  `LEVEL  name  message` layout at all, not merely a different name filled
  into the same slot. The line does not start with the message text quoted
  below, that text is what to look for **inside** the line. What it says
  depends on which version wrote it:
  - **1.9.0 and later:** a failed schema-migration backup logs a WARNING
    line containing `Rueckweg vor Schemasprung auf Version`, with the
    schema version next and then `nicht moeglich:` followed by the target
    path (the path comes **after** `nicht moeglich:`, not between the two
    search terms). A failed identifier-assignment backup logs its own,
    differently worded WARNING line instead — the words "Rueckweg vor
    Kennungsvergabe" plus `nicht moeglich:` — also followed by its own
    target path; worded differently from the schema-migration line on
    purpose since #105, but **not mutually exclusive**: if both a schema
    migration and an identifier assignment run in the same start and both
    backups fail, both WARNING lines appear together (the same "not
    exclusive" point the _Schema migrations_ section above makes for the
    success lines).
  - **In 1.8.0** — the release that introduced both rollback files; earlier
    releases do not have this code path at all, see the 1.8.0 and 1.7.0
    entries in `CHANGELOG.md` — both cases logged the _same_ text regardless
    of which one actually happened, each followed by the path:

    ```
    Sicherung vor Schemasprung nicht moeglich: <path>   (failure)
    Sicherung vor Schemasprung: <path>                  (success)
    ```

    The word "Schemasprung" in that line does not by itself tell you which
    case happened — it could equally have been an identifier assignment.
    **The path does, though, in both 1.8.0 and 1.9.0+:** it ends in
    `vor-schema-<N>.bak` for a schema migration or
    `vor-kennungsvergabe.bak` for an identifier assignment, regardless of
    which release logged the line.

  A failed backup does not stop the app, by design, in either case.

## Restore

1. Stop the container.
2. Restore a known-good ZFS snapshot. **To undo a migration, that is not
   enough on its own** — see _Undoing a migration_ below.
3. Reapply ownership `3006:3006`, directory mode `0700`, and file mode `0600`.
4. Start the container and verify `/api/health`.
5. Log in and test account status before running synchronization.

## Undoing a migration

**Roll the image back first.** Restoring the pre-migration file alone does not
work: the same container migrates again the moment it starts — and assigns
_new, different_ group identifiers while doing so. Measured. The naive
sequence is not merely useless; it moves the identifiers a second time.

The order that works:

1. Stop the container.
2. Check out the previous release and build it **without starting it**:
   `git checkout v<old>` and `GIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD) docker compose build`
   (not `up` — step 5 starts it).
3. Copy the matching rollback copy over `accounts.json`:
   `accounts.json.vor-schema-<N>.bak` for a schema migration,
   `accounts.json.vor-kennungsvergabe.bak` for an identifier assignment. Only
   if neither exists, fall back to `accounts.json.bak` — it may already carry
   the migrated state.
4. Reapply ownership `3006:3006`, directory `0700`, file `0600`.
5. Start it (`docker compose up -d`) and verify `/api/health` reports the old
   version.

Only then decide whether to upgrade again.

**Known limitation (#130): undoing a migration a second time.** If you have
already undone this migration once, worked with the old version, and upgraded
again, the app wrote no new `accounts.json.vor-schema-<N>.bak` on that latest
upgrade (and logged no `Rueckweg vor Schemasprung` line for it): the file
still holds the state from before the **first** upgrade, and copying it back
would lose everything you did in between. In that case, instead of step 3,
restore the ZFS snapshot you took right before the latest upgrade. Without
one, look at `accounts.json.vor-kennungsvergabe.bak`: if the log of the latest
upgrade shows a `Rueckweg vor Kennungsvergabe` line, that file holds the state
from right before that upgrade (it is written only if at least one album still
had no group identifier at that upgrade; an upgrade to 1.8.0 logs both copies
as `Sicherung vor Schemasprung:` instead — see above). If neither exists, what
you did in between is in no rollback copy. A fix is planned for a later
release.

Test restoration after setup and periodically thereafter. An untested backup is
only a hopeful collection of bytes.
